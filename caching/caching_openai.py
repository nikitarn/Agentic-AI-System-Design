"""Live demo: implicit prompt caching + token budgeting against the real OpenAI API (GPT-4o).


Unlike Anthropic, OpenAI's caching has no cache_control param and no separate
"write" price tier — caching is automatic for prompts >= 1024 tokens, matched
by prefix hash, and cached tokens simply bill cheaper on any request that
happens to hit. There's no way to force a hit or to know in advance whether
one will land; `prompt_cache_key` only nudges routing to improve hit odds.
